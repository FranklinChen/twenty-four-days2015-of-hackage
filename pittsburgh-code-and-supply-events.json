Node.js is a popular choice for building real-time applications, but it comes with some serious drawbacks.

In this session, two implementations of the same real-time application will be compared: one written in Node.js and one written in Elixir. You will learn how Node and Elixir solve the same problems in very different ways, and see how Elixir enables massive concurrency and fault tolerance with code that is callback-free, concise, testable, and easy to reason about.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/0\/5\/600_433362245.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>About our presenter<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/e\/9\/600_433362217.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Chris Geihsler<\/b> has been writing code professionally for 12 years in the healthcare and education industries using C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.
